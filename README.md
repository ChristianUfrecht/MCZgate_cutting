# MCZgate_cutting
A proof-of-principle implementation of multi-control Z (MCZ) gate cutting. The repository contains a notebook that guides through the proof-of-concept implementation of the multi-control Z gate cutting technique proposed in
Ufrecht et al., Cutting multi-control quantum gates with ZX calculus, Quantum 7, 1147 (2023). See https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-10-23-1147/
